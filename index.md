Hi There! 

<br><br>


My name is Saurabh Annadate and this is my personal website. It is an amalgamation of the several different important parts of myself. 

<br><br>

I am currently working as a Senior Associate, Data Science at Capital One in Tysons, VA in Customer Credit Risk Management. Here, I am responsible for building and and administering predictive analytics solutions to understand customer behavior to predict charge-off and estimate the overall dollar risk for Allowance calculation.  

<br> <br>

I am keenly interested in understanding and leveraging the power of data analytics to solve business problems. In my free time, I constantly try to explore new topics in the data science realm. I am currently focussing on upskilling myself in ML engoineering (building production pipelines arould ML models, which includes testing, explainability, reproducibility, monitoring etc.) and modelling for Natural Language Processing.

<br> <br>

Prior to joining Capital One, I graduated from Northwestern University having completed my Master of Science in Analytics. I have worked for three years as an Analyst in ZS Associates and hold a bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering from BITS Pilani, India.
