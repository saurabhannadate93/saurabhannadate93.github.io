Hi There! 

My name is Saurabh Annadate and this is my personal website. It is an amalgamation of the several different important parts of myself. 

I am currently working as a Senior Associate, Data Science at Capital One in Tysons, VA in Customer Credit Risk Management. Here, I am responsible for building and and administering predictive analytics solutions to understand customer behavior to predict charge-off and estimate the overall dollar risk for Allowance calculation.  

I am keenly interested in understanding and leveraging the power of data analytics to solve business problems. In my free time, I constantly try to explore new topics in the data science realm. I am currently focussing on upskilling myself in ML engoineering (building production pipelines arould ML models, which includes testing, explainability, reproducibility, monitoring etc.) and modelling for Natural Language Processing.

Prior to joining Capital One, I graduated from Northwestern University having completed my Master of Science in Analytics. I have worked for three years as an Analyst in ZS Associates and hold a bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering from BITS Pilani, India.

Outside of everything data, I love the mountains. As much as I am scared of height, the sheer magnificence of the himalayas attract me, and you will often find in some hill station cafe or trekking in the himalayas during my breaks. Over the past few years, I have travelled and trekked extensively across Himachal Pradesh, J&K, Leh/Ladakh and Darjeeling. I wish to pursue the ABC and the EBC treks as soon as I get the opportunity. I am also an avid photographer, and I try to capture life moments whenever I can.

In my spare time, I'm interested in learning more on health and nutrition, getting fitter, playing around with coding projects, improving my cooking skills, exploring new places to eat, reading books, and reading people!
