## COMPETITION DETAILS 

The 2019 Humana-Mays Healthcare Analytics Case Competition involved two levels of submissions and three rounds of evaluation. For level one submissions, we were required to develop a predictive model, score a holdout dataset and provide an analysis write-up. For level two, we had to present our findings to a panel comprising of Humana executives and Mays Business School faculty.
